## Shark Attacks Dataset - README

### Introduction

Welcome to the Shark Attacks Dataset! This dataset is designed to help to understand the patterns and circumstances of shark attacks across the globe. By using pandas, a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python, we been able to create, manipulate, and analyze large and complex datasets. This dataset provides valuable informations to dive deep into the world of shark attacks, identifying trends, risks, and preventive measures.

Happy analyzing! 🦈

About the Dataset

Context

The dataset comprises information on shark attacks worldwide. It provides detailed records of incidents, including the date, location, type of activity at the time of the attack, and characteristics of the victims. This data can be explored to identify safer travel destinations, recommend safer water activities, and understand the profile of typical shark attack victims.

#### Content

This dataset offers a comprehensive look at various aspects of shark attacks. It includes both categorical and numerical variables, providing insights into the timing, location, nature of the attack, and details about the victims.

#### Acknowledgements

The dataset is sourced from the Global Shark Attack File (GSAF).

#### Inspiration

The data is useful for understanding the geographical distribution and circumstances of shark attacks. It helps in identifying safer travel destinations and water activities, as well as in creating awareness and preventive strategies to minimize the risk of shark attacks.

### Data Description

- *Date*: The exact date of the shark attack.
- *Year*: The year when the attack occurred.
- *Type*: The type of shark attack (e.g., provoked, unprovoked).
- *Country*: The country where the shark attack took place.
- *State*: The state or region within the country where the attack occurred.
- *Location*: Specific location or beach where the attack happened.
- *Activity*: The activity the person was engaged in at the time of the attack (e.g., surfing, swimming).
- *Name*: The name of the victim.
- *Sex*: The gender of the victim.
- *Age*: The age of the victim.
- *Injury*: The type of injury sustained during the attack.
- *Species*: The species of shark involved in the attack.

### Hypotheses

Based on the dataset, you might explore the following hypotheses:
1. Coastal countries with less tourism have fewer shark attacks.
2. Surface water activities (e.g., kayaking, windsurfing) are less risky than underwater activities (e.g., diving, snorkeling).
3. Certain seasons have higher frequencies of shark attacks!
